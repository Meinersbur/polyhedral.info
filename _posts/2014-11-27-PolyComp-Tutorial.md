At HiPEAC 2015, the [PolyComp
2015](https://www.hipeac.org/2015/amsterdam/workshop-and-tutorials/) tutorial
will discuss *polyhedral compilation without polyhedra*.

This tutorial follows the tradition of the Omega Project and use a
slightly higher-level representation based on integer tuples bounded by
quasi-affine constraints, called named Presburger sets. In particular,
the following topics will be addressed

 * How to model various aspects of a piece of code using Presburger sets and
relations. 
 * Which basic operations are available on such sets and relations, without
  going into details on how these operations are implemented.

 * How to use these operations to mainly analyze but also transform programs.
 
 * Which tools are available for polyhedral compilation.

 * A small selection of some of the results that may be achieved through
   polyhedral compilation.

An earlier version of this tutorial was presented as the first half of a
lecture at the polyhedral school, but some of the material will be updated and
some extra material will be added.
