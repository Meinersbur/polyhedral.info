IMPACT 2015

5th International Workshop on 
Polyhedral Compilation Techniques

http://impact.gforge.inria.fr/impact2015/ [1]

Jan 19, 2015, in conjunction with HiPEAC 2015 (Jan 19-21, 2015)
Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

======================================
IMPORTANT DATES:
Abstract submission: October 17, 2014
Paper submission: October 24, 2014 (NO EXTENSION!)
Author notification: November 22, 2014
Final version due: December 8, 2014
Workshop date: January 19, 2015
======================================

OVERVIEW:

With ubiquitous multicore processors and the increasing role of hardware
accelerators, polyhedral compilation techniques have gained a lot of attention
in both academia and industry. Polyhedral compilation provides a homogeneous
framework to design effective optimizations for high performance computing,
addressing coarse-grain and fine-grain parallelism, distributed- and
shared-memory parallelism. IMPACT is a unique workshop focusing exclusively on
polyhedral compilation technologies, bringing together researchers and
practitioners for a high-quality one-day event including technical paper
presentations and panel discussions (and possibly a keynote talk).

We welcome both theoretical and experimental papers on all aspects of
polyhedral compilation and optimization. We also welcome submissions describing
preliminary results, crazy new ideas, position papers, experience reports, and
available tools, with an aim to stimulate discussions, collaborations, and
advances in the field.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
- program optimization (automatic parallelization, tiling, etc.)
- code generation
- data/communication management on GPUs, accelerators and
 distributed systems
- hardware/high-level synthesis for affine programs
- static analysis
- program verification
- model checking
- theoretical foundations of the polyhedral model
- extensions of the polyhedral model
- scalability and robustness of polyhedral compilation techniques
- tool demonstration

SUBMISSION:

Submissions should not exceed 8 pages (recommended 6 pages) formatted as per
ACM proceedings format. Please use the following template when preparing your
manuscript: http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates

Submissions should be in PDF format and printable on US Letter or A4 sized
paper. Please send your submission by the deadline to:
impact-chairs@lists.gforge.inria.fr

Please indicate in your email if you wish to submit as a:
(1) regular paper
(2) position paper
(3) wild and crazy idea
(4) tool demonstration

Proceedings will be published online. If the final version of an accepted paper
does not sufficiently address the comments of the reviewers, then it may be
accompanied by a note from the program committee. Publication at IMPACT will
not prevent later publication in conferences or journals of the presented work.
