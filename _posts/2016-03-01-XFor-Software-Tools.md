All the software tools related to
the XFOR loop programming structure are now available by following this
link: [http://xfor.gforge.inria.fr](http://xfor.gforge.inria.fr)

The tools include:
- the source-to-source compiler IBB, that translates any XFOR program into an
  equivalent FOR program;

- the XFOR programming environment XFOR-Wizard, that automatically checks if
  data dependences are respected when editing an XFOR program from a
  referential FOR program;

- the XFOR generator XFORGEN, that automatically generates an XFOR program from
  a loop specification in OpenScop format.

We wish you pleasant XFOR programming.
