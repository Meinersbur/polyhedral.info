title: Polyhedral Compilation
---

<h1>Polyhedral Compilation</h1>

Polyhedral compilation techniques use a high-level mathematical representation
based on polyhedra <a class="citation">LOECHNER1997PARAMETERIZED</a> or
Presburger relations <a class="citation">PUGH1994STATIC</a> to analyze and
optimize compute programs. There is a wide range of possible uses for such
techniques including data-locality optimizations, automatic-parallelisation,
memory-requirement analysis, SIMDization, accellerator code generation and even
hardware synthesis. There has been experience in using such techniques in
static, just-in-time compilers and DSL compilers. The polyhedral research
community has a strong academic background, but more and more industry users
start to adapt such technologies as well.

[polyhedral.info](http://polyhedral.info) provides information about the
polyhedral compilation community including both the latest developments
as well as an overview of existing work.  Heavily relying on community <a
href="/contribute.html">contribution</a>, it provides information about
[software](software.html) that uses polyhedral compilation techniques, the
latest [publications](publications.html) in this area as well as [community
events](events.html).
